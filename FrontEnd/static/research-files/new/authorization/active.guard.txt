/**
 * ActiveGuard is a custom guard implementation used in NestJS to determine
 * whether a given request should be allowed to proceed. It checks if the user
 * is authenticated and their account is confirmed, but it does not check for admin privileges.
 *
 * This guard is typically used in routes that require a user to be signed in
 * and have a confirmed account status. It ensures that only active users who are not blocked
 * can access protected resources.
 *
 * @implements {CanActivate} from NestJS common module, providing the canActivate method
 * @see {AuthenticatedRequest} for the extended request object with user session details
