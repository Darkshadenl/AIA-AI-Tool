# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Setup launchsettings (default based on launchSettings.example.json should be fine).

Setup appsettings (use appsettings.example.json and fill in the blanks).
AzureBlobStorage isn't being used right now, but it's there for future use.
In the settings section, the path should be absolute.

## Database

The database is setup using Entity Framework Core. To setup the database, run the following commands:

Tool which is needed to run the commands below:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Update database with migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```


## Running the application

If you want the webbook to work, you need to setup a tunneling service like Ngrok or localtunnel.
Setting up localtunnel is the easiest:

Replace the port number with the port your app is listening on:
```bash
npx localtunnel --port {port}
```

### Now change the appsettings file.

The format of the WebhookUrl value:
```bash
{url}/${dbPredictionId}
```

Example:
```bash
https://proud-news-arrive.loca.lt/api/replicate-webhook/${dbPredictionId}
```

url is the url which is generated by localtunnel
