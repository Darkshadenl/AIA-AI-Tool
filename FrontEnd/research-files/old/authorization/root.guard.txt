/**
 * RootGuard is a custom guard implementing the CanActivate interface, designed to protect
 * routes that only require user-level access.
 * It ensures that the incoming request is from an
 * authenticated user with confirmed status, not blocked, and possesses user and root
 * privileges.
 * This guard is typically used to secure general endpoints that perform standard
 * system operations or configuration changes.
 *
 * The canActivate method checks a single condition on the user object attached to the request
 * to determine if the request should be allowed to proceed. If any of the conditions are met,
 * access is granted, and the route is executed.
 *
 * @implements {CanActivate} from NestJS common module, providing a method to determine if a route can be deactivated
