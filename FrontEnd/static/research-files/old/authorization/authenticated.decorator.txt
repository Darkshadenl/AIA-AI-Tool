/**
 * `Authenticated` is a custom decorator that applies the `AuthenticatedGuard` to either
 * a whole class or specific methods within a class. It is used to ensure that only
 * authorized personnel can access the decorated class or methods.
 * This decorator is typically used in services to protect routes that require a user
 * to be signed up. It simplifies the enforcement of authorization by abstracting the guard
 * application logic into a reusable decorator.
